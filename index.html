            In August of 2015, to start off our 6 year anniversary, Ray and I had an early morning photoshoot planned with a photographer. The ending is fairly obvious - after a cue from the photographer my best friend got down on one knee and asked me to marry him! But what most people don't know is that he had perfectly planned this day a year and a half in advance...
          </p>
          <p class="text-center">
            Four years ago, Ray and I had a fun photoshoot with a friend who had just started a photography business. We had so much fun we agreed that one day, when it was time to get married, he would be the one there to take our pictures. A year and a half later, after Ray realized that our future 6 year anniversary date was the perfect day to get engaged, he called our photographer and booked a photoshoot. Fast forward another year and a half - I had just graduated and landed an amazing job, so Ray wanted to celebrate! He “planned” a photoshoot for us the morning of our anniversary, which of course I was a little suspicious of, but didn’t want to assume anything. Before I knew it, it was time for the photoshoot! Ray and I were chatting and being silly as usual while the photographer was taking a few test shots. He then tells us, “Almost ready, y’all. Just need to change this lens.” Little did I know, this was Ray’s cue. He said some really sweet things, got down on one knee, and of course I said yes! We laughed, we cried, we laughed some more, and spent the rest of the day celebrating.

      Arturo is one of Ray’s cousins, and they’re so close they’re practically brothers! These guys always like to joke around, and there is no shortage of laughter when the two are together. When they were growing up you would never see one without the other, and even now that they’re older it still seems the same.

      Carlos, another cousin, was someone Ray always looked up to like a big brother. Carlos introduced Ray into the world of sports, which became a big part of his life. Ray is appreciative of everything Carlos has brought into his life, except for those past two fantasy football championship wins!

      “JJ” is Richelle’s older sister and only sibling! Their 8 year age gap made sharing a bathroom quite difficult when they both lived at home (Richelle was SO annoying to teenage JJ!) but now that they are older the gap doesn’t seem so far. JJ is not only the best sister, but a fantastic mom to a little red-headed bundle of fire we like to call Gare-Bear.

      The best thing about Richelle’s first (and horrible) art history class was meeting her best friend. Erin made the first move in this friendship, which was ironically out of character, and the two were inseparable since then! Both of their fiances have realized that the two of them can have an entire conversation just by looking at each other. It’s like they have ESPN or something ;)

      Laura and Richelle met at their first teen job at American Eagle and instantly became best friends while folding jeans, learning how to work a cash register, and talking about how cute those Jonas Brothers were! Laura played a little bit of a matchmaker when she noticed the spark between Ray and Richelle! These two girls have never let the miles between them separate their friendship, or their love of being total dorks together.

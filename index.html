            In August of 2015, to start off our 6 year anniversary, Ray and I had an early morning photoshoot planned with a photographer. The ending is fairly obvious - after a cue from the photographer my best friend got down on one knee and asked me to marry him! But what most people don't know is that he had perfectly planned this day a year and a half in advance...

            Four years ago, Ray and I had a fun photoshoot with a friend who had just started a photography business. We had so much fun we agreed that one day, when it was time to get married, he would be the one there to take our pictures. A year and a half later, after Ray realized that our future 6 year anniversary date was the perfect day to get engaged, he called our photographer and booked a photoshoot. Fast forward another year and a half - I had just graduated and landed an amazing job, so Ray wanted to celebrate! He “planned” a photoshoot for us the morning of our anniversary, which of course I was a little suspicious of, but didn’t want to assume anything. Before I knew it, it was time for the photoshoot! Ray and I were chatting and being silly as usual while the photographer was taking a few test shots. He then tells us, “Almost ready, y’all. Just need to change this lens.” Little did I know, this was Ray’s cue. He said some really sweet things, got down on one knee, and of course I said yes! We laughed, we cried, we laughed some more, and spent the rest of the day celebrating.
